scrollbars### Mouse Interaction in Turtle

Turtle has two functions that can be used to detect mouse pressing: `onclick()` and `onrelease()`. 

The `onclick()` function calls a function whenever we click on the turtle. The function name is passed as an argument and the function has to take two parameters indicating the current (x, y) coordinate of the turtle. 

```python
# Importing the turtle module
from turtle import *
from turtle import _CFG  # we need this to remove the scrollers

# Resizes the default canvas size to prevent scrollers
_CFG["canvwidth"] = 1 
_CFG["canvheight"] = 1

# Creates a window with the size 400 by 300 and sets the title
setup(400, 300)
title("My Turtle Animation")

# Nancy is back
nancy = Turtle()
nancy.shape("turtle")
nancy.speed(6)
nancy.color("firebrick")

# This function gets called when we click on Nancy
def spin(x, y):
  """Nancy goes forward then spins in a circle."""
  nancy.forward(100)
  nancy.circle(30)
  nancy.left(90)

nancy.onclick(spin)

# Hides the turtle after they are done drawing
hideturtle()

# Keeps the program running after the drawing is complete
done()
```

The `onrelease()` function is just like `onclick()` except it calls the function when we let go of a mouse button.

```python
# Importing the turtle module
from turtle import *
from turtle import _CFG  # we need this to remove the scrollers

# Resizes the default canvas size to prevent scrollers
_CFG["canvwidth"] = 1 
_CFG["canvheight"] = 1

# Creates a window with the size 400 by 300 and sets the title
setup(400, 300)
title("My Turtle Animation")

# Nancy is back
nancy = Turtle()
nancy.shape("turtle")
nancy.speed(6)
nancy.color("firebrick")

# This function gets called when we click and let go of Nancy
def spin(x, y):
  """Nancy goes forward then spins in a circle."""
  nancy.forward(100)
  nancy.circle(30)
  nancy.left(90)

nancy.onrelease(spin)

# Hides the turtle after they are done drawing
hideturtle()

# Keeps the program running after the drawing is complete
done()
```

For both `onclick()` and `onrelease()`, we can pass a second argument indicating the mouse button. `1` is left click, `2` is middle click, and `3` is right click.
