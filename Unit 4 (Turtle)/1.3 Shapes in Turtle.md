### Shapes in Turtle

We can draw polygons using just `forward()`, `left()`, and `right()`. Here are some examples of polygons.

```python
# Importing the turtle module
from turtle import *
from turtle import _CFG  # we need this to remove the scrollers

# Resizes the default canvas size to prevent scrollers
_CFG["canvwidth"] = 1 
_CFG["canvheight"] = 1

# Creates a window with the size 400 by 300 and sets the title
setup(400, 300)
title("My Turtle Animation")

# Creates a Turtle object with a turtle shape
shape("turtle")

# Draws a square
penup()
goto(-180, 130)
pendown()
for i in range(4):
  forward(50)
  right(90)

# Draws a triangle
penup()
goto(-20, 20)
pendown()
for i in range(3):
  forward(50)
  right(120)

# Draws a pentagon
penup()
goto(100, -60)
pendown()
for i in range(5):
  forward(50)
  right(72)

# Hides the turtle after they are done drawing
hideturtle()

# Keeps the program running after the drawing is complete
done()
```

If we want to draw a circle, we can use the `circle()` function.
