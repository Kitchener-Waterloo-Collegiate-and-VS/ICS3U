### Time in Pygame

Pygame has a `time` module for keeping track of time. One we initialize pygame with `init()`, we can use `time.get_ticks()` to see how many milliseconds it has been since `init()` was called. 

This program prints a message to the console about how any milliseconds have passed since the start of the program whenever we left-click the mouse.

```python
from pygame import *

init()
screen = display.set_mode((400, 300))

while True:
  for e in event.get():
    if e.type == MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:
      current_time = time.get_ticks()
      print(f"It has been {current_time} milliseconds since the start of the program.")
  display.update()
```

If we want to know how much time has passed since a particular point, we can keep track of the start and end time and take the difference.

```python
from pygame import *

init()
screen = display.set_mode((400, 300))

timing = False

while True:
  for e in event.get():
    if e.type == MOUSEBUTTONDOWN
        if timing:  # ensures that it waits until the second click
          previous_time = current_time # updates the time of the second most current click
          current_time = time.get_ticks() # updates the time of the current click
          print(f"It has been {current_time - previous_time} milliseconds since your last click.")
        else:  # this is for the first click
          timing = True
          current_time = time.get_ticks() 
  display.update()
```
