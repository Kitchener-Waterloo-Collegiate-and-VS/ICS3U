### Tkinter

Tkinter (pronounced "tee-kinter" or "tuh-kinter" or "tee-kay-inter", short for Tk interface) is a package in the Python Standard Library and it's the de facto package used to create GUIs (graphic used interfaces). A GUI (pronounced "gooey") is a way of interacting with a computer. Examples of GUIs include windows, icons, and menus.

There are a few lines of code that we need to include in every Tkinter program.

```python
# Importing Tkinter
from tkinter import *

# Creates the window
Tk()

# Keeps the program running and updating
mainloop()
```

1. We first need to import the `tkinter` package.
2. We then need to create a window to put the graphics on.
3. Lastly, we need to keep the program running so that the window keeps displaying, which is what `mainloop()` does. This will keep the program running indefinitely until we hit the Stop button.

Here is the result of this program.
