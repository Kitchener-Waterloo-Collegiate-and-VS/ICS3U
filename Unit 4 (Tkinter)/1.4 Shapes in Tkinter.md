### Shapes in Tkinter

In order to draw shapes in Tkinter, we need to put a canvas on the window. We use the `Canvas()` constructor to create the canvas and pass the window, width, and height as keyword arguments. Then we use the `pack()` method to make the size of the window fit the canvas fit the window and display it. 

```python
from tkinter import *

# Creates the window and canvas
window = Tk()
canvas = Canvas(window, width = 400, height = 300) # creates a canvas that is 400px by 300px that will go on the window
canvas.pack()  # puts the canvas on the window and adjusts the size of the window accordingly

# Keeps the program running and updating
mainloop()
```

Now we can draw shapes on the canvas using the following methods:
* `create_line()`
* `create_rectangle()`
* `create_oval()`
* `create_polygon()`
* `create_arc()`

Here are a few examples of drawing shapes.

```python
from tkinter import *

# Creates the window and canvas
window = Tk()
canvas = Canvas(window, width = 400, height = 300, background = "black") # creates a canvas that is 400px by 300px that will go on the window
canvas.pack()  # puts the canvas on the window and adjusts the size of the window accordingly

# Draws a green circle
canvas.create_oval(100, 50, 200, 150, fill = "green1")

# Draws a red rectangle
canvas.create_rectangle(25, 25, 75, 90, fill = "red")

# Draws a blue triangle
canvas.create_polygon(250, 250, 225, 150, 150, 275, fill = "blue")

# Draws a white line
canvas.create_line(350, 50, 350, 250, fill = "white", width = 15)

# Keeps the program running and updating
mainloop()
```

The shapes above look like this:
