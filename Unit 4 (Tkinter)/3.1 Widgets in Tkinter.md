### Widgets in Tkinter

So far we've been using a canvas to draw shapes, images, and text. This is not the only way to use Tkinter, so we'll be exploring other uses.

A **widget** is an individual element of a GUI. Tkinter widgets include: labels, buttons, text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, scales, dropdown menus, message boxes, and so on.  

Each of these widgets have their own class. The constructor takes the window and a variety of keyword arguments representing **properties** of the widget.

For example, here is a `Label` constructor being called.

```python
label = Label(window, fill = "blue", text = "hi", background = "white")  # initializes a label
```

Once we create a widget, we still have to place it onto the window. We can do so using the `pack()` method or `grid()` method. For now we'll use `pack()`.

```python
label = Label(window, fill = "blue", text = "hi", background = "white")  # initializes a label
label.pack()  # places the label onto the window
```

If we want to access or change the property of a widget, the syntax is similar to access a value in a dictionary by its key.

```python
label = Label(window, fill = "blue", text = "hi", background = "white")
label.pack()

print(label["text"]). # prints 'hi'
label["text"] = "hello" # changes the 'text' property to 'hello'
print(label["text"]) # prints 'hi'
```

Here's a program that creates a window with a label in it.

```python
from tkinter import *

# Creates the window
window = Tk()

# Creates a label for some text to go on
label = Label(window, text = "Hello  World!")  # creates the label
label.pack()  # puts the label on the window and adjusts the size of the window accordingly

# Keeps the program running and updating
mainloop()
```
