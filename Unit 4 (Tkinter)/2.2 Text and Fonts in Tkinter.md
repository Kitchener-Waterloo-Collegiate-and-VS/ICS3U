### Text and Fonts in Tkinter 

We can place text on a canvas using `create_text()`. The parameters are `(x, y, **kwargs)` where (x, y) is the coordinate of the text and by default's it's the center. The keyword argument for the text is `text`. 

```python
from tkinter import *

# Creates the window
window = Tk()

# The size of the canvas
WIDTH = 400
HEIGHT = 300

# Creates the canvas for the image and text to go on
canvas = Canvas(window, width = WIDTH, height = HEIGHT)
canvas.pack()

# Puts text on the canvas
canvas.create_text(WIDTH/2, HEIGHT/2, text = "Hello  World!")

# Keeps the program running and updating
mainloop()
```

Other keyword arguments for `create_text()` include:

* `anchor` for the text alignment
* `fill` for the colour of the text
* `font` represented as a tuple `(font_name, font_size, font_styling)`
* `width` for the maximum length of the line
