### Boolean Operators with Integers

Recall that `or` and `and` are boolean operators that take boolean expressions. What do you think would happen if we used numeric values instead?

```
> 3 or 5
?
> 3 and 5
?
```

We might think that the numbers get converted into booleans. If that were the case, `3 or 5` would be equivalent to `True or True` which is `True` and `3 and 5` would be equivalent to `True and True` which is also `True`.

Here's what we actually get:

```
> 3 or 5
3
> 3 and 5
5
```

This is because `or` and `and` actually return the last evaluated argument, which is not necessarily a boolean.

```
> 0 or 5
5
> 0 and 5
0
> False or 7
7
> True and 0
0
```


Here is [the documentation for `or` and `and`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#boolean-operations).
