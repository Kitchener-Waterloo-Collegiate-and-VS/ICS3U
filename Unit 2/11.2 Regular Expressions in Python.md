### Regular Expressions in Python

Python has a module called `re` that implements regular expressions. You can `import` it to get access to functions such as `re.search()` and `re.findall()`.

The function `re.search()` takes a pattern and a string and returns a `Match` object if there is match and `None` otherwise. 

In the example below, the string `"hello world"` matches the pattern `"^h"` since it begins with `h` but it does not match the pattern `"^H"` since it doesn't begin with `H`.

```python
import re

print(re.search("^h", "hello world"))  # prints a Match object
print(re.search("^H", "hello world"))  # prints None since there was no match

```

The function `re.findall()` takes a pattern and a string and returns a list of all the substrings that match the pattern.

In the examples below, the pattern `"[t|T]h"` matches `"th"` and `"Th"` and the pattern `[a-z]*at[a-z]*` matches lowercase words that contain `at`.

```python
import re

print(re.findall(r"[t|T]h", "the Then that what other"))  # prints ['th', 'Th', 'th', 'th']
print(re.findall(r"[a-z]*at[a-z]*", "at that hat cat fog dog late"))  # prints ['at', 'that', 'hat', 'cat', 'late']
```

*Tip*: Use r-prefix strings to avoid problems with escape characters.
