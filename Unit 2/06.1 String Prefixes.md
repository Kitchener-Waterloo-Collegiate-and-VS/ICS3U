### String Prefixes

In Python, we can use **string prefixes** to modify the way strings are displayed.

Consider the following print statement:

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
name = name.title()
print("Welcome, " + name + "!")
```

We can improve the readability by formatting the string using an **f-prefix** (the *f* stands for *format*). To use an f-prefix, we place an `f` in front of the opening quotation mark and enclose variable names in curly braces inside the string.

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
name = name.title()
print(f"Welcome, {name}!")   # this is an f-prefix
```

Consider the following multi-line string and note the escape character in the second line of the cat:

```python
cat = """
.         .
 \\'-"'"-'/
  } 6 6 {
  =. Y .=        
   /^^^\ .      
  /     \ )      
  ( )-( )/       
   "" "" 
""" 
```

We can avoid needing escape characters by using an **r-prefix**. We do that by putting `r` in front of the opening quotation mark. This will make the string **raw**, meaning every character shows up exactly as shown.


```python
cat = r"""
.         .  
 \'-"'"-'/
  } 6 6 {   
  =. Y .=    
   /^^^\ .   
  /     \ )   
  ( )-( )/    
  "" ""
""" 
```
