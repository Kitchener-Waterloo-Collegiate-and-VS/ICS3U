### Sets

A **set** is a non-ordered collection of unique items. A set uses curly braces `{}` as delimiters. The individual items are separated by commas.

```python
numbers = {1, 4, 7, 12, 19}
```

Two sets are equivalent if they contain the same items. The order of the items doesn't matter.

```python
numbers1 = {1, 4, 7, 12, 19}

numbers2 = {12, 1, 4, 19, 7}

print(numbers1 == numbers2)  # prints True
```

A set cannot contain duplicate items. If we add an item to a set that is already there, it doesn't change anything.

```python
numbers1 = {1, 4, 7, 12, 19}

numbers2 = {1, 4, 7, 12, 19, 4, 7}

print(numbers1 == numbers2)  # prints True
```

A set does not have indices. For example, we cannot get the "first item" in a set, since there is no order to the items.

```python
numbers = {1, 4, 7, 12, 19}

print(numbers[0])  # raises an error
```

Since the items in a set aren't in any particular order, the items might not get printed in the same order as were added in. The order in which the items are outputted depends on where they are stored in memory, which could be different every time the program is run.


```python
numbers = {0, 5, 10, 15, 20}

print(numbers)  # prints {0, 5, 10, 15, 20}, but the order of the items might be different
```

### set()

If we want to initialize an empty set, we need to use `set()`. If we try to initialize an empty set using `{}`, it won't work as intended because the program will treat it like a **dictionary**, which also uses curly braces as delimiters. We'll learn about dictionaries later.

```python
numbers = set()  # creates an empty set
```

We can also cast a list or a string to a set using `set()`.

```python
print(set([1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4]))  # prints {1, 2, 3, 4} (the order might be different)
print(set("Hello"))  # prints {'H', 'e', 'l', 'o'} (the order might be different)
```

### Looping Through Sets

Sets can be iterated through using a `for` loop.

```python
numbers = {1, 4, 7, 12, 19}
total = 0

for n in numbers:
  total += n  # adds together all the numbers in the set

print(total)  # prints 43
```

### Set Methods

To add items to a set, we can use `.add()`. To remove items from a set, we can use `.remove()`. 

```python
numbers = {1, 4, 7, 12, 19}

numbers.add(5)  # adds 5 to the set
numbers.add(7)  # doesn't do anything since 7 is already in the set
numbers.remove(12)  # removes 12 from the set

print(numbers)  # prints {1, 4, 5, 7, 19} (the order could be different)
```

There are several other methods we can use. Here is the [full list of set methods](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set).

### Set Operators

**Set theory** is a branch of mathematics. In Python, we can find properties of sets using many of the set operations from set theory. Some of the symbols might be familiar from math class. 

| Description | Operator in Python | Name in Set Theory | Symbol in Set Theory |
| --- | --- | ---| --- |
| Checking whether an item is in a set | `in` | "item of",  "element of", "belongs to", "contained in" | ∈ |
| Checking whether two sets have the same items | `==` | "equality" | = |
| Checking whether all the items of a set are contained in another set | `<=` | "subset" | ⊆ | 
| Checking whether all the items of a set are contained in another set, and the two sets are not the same | `<` | "proper subset" | ⊂ | 
| Checking whether a set contains all the items of another set  | `>=` | "superset" | ⊇ | 
| Checking whether a set contains all the items of another set, and the two sets are not the same  | `>` | "proper superset" | ⊃ | 
| Finding the number of items in a set | `len()` | "cardinality", "size" | \| set \| | 
| Combining of all the items of two or more sets | `|` | "union" | ⋃ |
| Combining of all the items in common between/among two or more sets | `&` | "intersection" | ⋂ | 
| Removing the common items between a set and another set | `-` | "difference", "relative component"  | – | 
| Keeping the items that appear in exactly one of two sets | `^` | "symmetric difference" | Δ or ⊖ | 

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}

print(1 in set1)  # prints True
print(set1 == set2)  # prints False
print(set2 <= set2)  # prints True
print(set2 > set2)  # prints False
print(len(set2))  # prints 4
print(set1 | set2)  # prints {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
print(set1 & set2)  # prints {3, 4}
print(set1 - set2)  # prints {1, 2}
print(set1 ^ set2)  # prints {1, 2, 5, 6}
```

The operations that return a Boolean values can can be negataed with `not`. Replace `set1` and `set2` with the actual name of your sets and `item` with the value of an item or its variable.

| Expression in Python                 | Symbol in Set Theory |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| `item not in set1`                   | ∉                    |
| `set1 != set2` or `not set1 == set2` | =                    |
| `not set1 < set2`                    | ⊄                    |
| `not set1 <= set2`                   | ⊈ or ⊊               |
| `not set1 > set2`                    | ⊅                    |
| `not set1 >= set2`                   | ⊉ or ⊋               |
