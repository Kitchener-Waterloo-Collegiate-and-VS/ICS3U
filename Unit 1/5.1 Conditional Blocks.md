### Conditional Blocks

Conditional blocks can take up more than one line. When they do, each line must begin with the same indentation.

```python
number = int(input("Pick a number between 1 and 10: "))

if number > 10:
  print("Your number is too high!")
  print("Try again next time.")  # same indentation as above
elif number < 1:
  print("Your number is too low!")
  print("Try again next time.") # same indentation as above
else:
  print("Thanks.")
```
