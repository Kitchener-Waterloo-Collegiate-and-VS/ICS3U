### String Operators

We can merge strings using the `+` operator.  The process of merging strings is called **string concatenation**.

The lines below print `"butterfly"`.

```python
print("butterfly")  # prints "butterfly"
print("butter" + " fly")  # also prints "butterfly"
```

We can use the `*` operator for **string multiplication**.

The line below prints `"hahaha"`.

```python
print("ha" * 3)  # prints "hahaha"
```

### Special Characters

In order to put any of the following special characters in a string, you need to put the **escape character** ``\`` (backslash) in front of it. In Replit, characters that are escaped turn pink.

The backslash is also considered to be a string operator. 

| Name | Special Character |
| --- | --- |
| tab | `\t` |
| new line | `\n`|
| backslash | `\\` |
| single quotation mark | `\'` (You only need to use this when the string in enclosed in single quotation marks.) |
| double quotation mark | `\"` (You only need to use this when the string in enclosed in double quotation marks.) |
