### One-line Conditionals

Sometimes, conditionals take up only one line. 
In general, it's much easier to read and understand conditionals written in the standard way, but we might occasionally see the one-liners when looking at other people's code on the Internet.

```python
pick = int(input("Pick a positive integer: "))

# Standard way
if 0 < pick:
  print("Thanks.")

# One-liner
if 0 < pick: print("Thanks.")  # this works too
```

If the conditional block takes up more than one line, we can still rewrite it in one line using semicolons.

```python
pick = int(input("Pick a positive integer: "))

# Standard way
if pick <= 0:
  print("That's not a positive integer...")
  print("Try again next time.")

# One-liner
if pick <= 0: print("That's not a positive integer..."); print("Try again next time.")  # this works too
```

When we have a short `if`-`else` structure, we could also combine them onto one line.

```python
pick = int(input("Pick a positive integer: "))

# Standard way
if 0 < pick:
  print("Thanks.")
else:
  print("That's not a positive integer...")

# One-liner
print("Thanks." if 0 < pick else "That's not a positive integer...")  # this works too
```
