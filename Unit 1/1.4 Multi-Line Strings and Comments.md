### Multi-Line Strings and Comments

A multi-line strings is a string that takes up multiple lines of code. In Python, they start with `'''` or `"""` and end the same way.

```python
numbers = '''3
5
6
7
'''  
```

We can also use the same syntax for multi-line comments.

```python
''' This is a multi-line comment.
It takes up more than one line of code.
'''  
```

In a multi-line string, we don't need any escape characters unless we have a backslash that is escaping the next character when we don't want it to.

```python
s1 = ''' \"
'''
s2 = ''' \\"
'''

print(s1)  # prints "
print(s2)  # prints \"
```

If we put a backslash at the end of a line in a multi-line string, it concatenates the line with the next line. This is called a **line break**.

```python
s = """Hello \
World!"""

print(s) # prints "Hello World!"
```
