### Replit

In this course, we will be using [Replit](http://replit.com) to write Python programs. Replit is a web-based programming environment. It is not the best programming environment since it can be laggy at times, however we are using it since it can run on Chromebooks.

Here is an example of a Python program on Replit:

### Source Code Editor

The **source code editor** is the place where we type in the code for our program. In Replit, the source code editor is the white window in the middle of the screen. The numbers along the left side of the source code editor are the **line numbers**.

The source code editor displays our code using **syntax highlighting**. Different parts of our code light up in different colours based on various categories. Different source code editors have different scolour schemes.

The source code editor also helps us with **syntax errors**. **Syntax** refers to the rules of a programming language, similar to how grammar refers to the rules of a human language. We will see **red squiggly lines** when we have a syntax error, similar to how we see a red squiggly line when we mispell a word in a text editor such as Google Doc. We will also see **green squiggly lines** for warnings.

### Python Interpreter

Python is an **interpreted language**, meaning
it uses an interpreter instead of a compiler. One of the main differences is that we can partially run a Python program with syntax errors, whereas in a compiled language we cannot run program at all if they have a syntax erorr.

When we run a Python program via the *Run* â–¶ button at the top of the screen, the **Python interpreter** translates the source code into **bytecode** for a **virtual machine** to execute. The Virtual Machine translates the bytecode into **machine code**, which is written entirely in binary (1s and 0s).

### The Console

The **console**, also known as the output window, is the default location where text gets printed to. In programming, **printing** refers to displaying text somewhere on the screen.

In Replit, the console is the black window on the right side of the screen.
