### Pass

If we try to make the body of a conditional or loop blank, we end up getting an `IndexError`.


```python
num = int(input("Enter a positive integer: ))
if num > 0:

print("Hello")  # This raises an IndexError
```

```python
while True:

print("Hello")  # This raises an IndexError
```

If we are creating a loop but we want to leave it blank for the time being, we can use the `pass` keyword. This is useful when we are working on several part of a program at the same time.


```python
num = int(input("Enter a positive integer: ))

if num > 0:
  pass # I haven't finished this part yet

print("Hello") # This works
```

```python
while True:
  pass # I haven't finished this part yet

print("Hello") # This works
```
