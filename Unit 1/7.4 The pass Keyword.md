### Pass

If we try to make the body of a function blank, we end up getting an `IndexError`.


```python
def is_odd_number(num):

print("Hello")  # This raises an IndexError
```
If we are creating a custom function but we want to leave the body blank, we can use the `pass` keyword. This is useful when we are working on several part of a program at the same time.


```python
def is_odd_number(num):
  pass # I haven't finished this part yet

print("Hello") # This works
```
