### Variables and Data Types

A **variable** is value that can change over time. 

A **constant** is a value that cannot change over time. 

A **data type** is the kind of data that variables and constants can store.

All data types are either primitive or composite. A **primitive data type** (a.k.a. a **basic data type**) represents a single piece of information. If a data type isn't primitive, it is a **composite data type**. Whether a data type is primitive or composite depends on the programming language. Here are the four primitive data types in Python. 

| Data Type | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Integer | Any integer. There is no upper or lower limit to how high or low it can be. |
| Float | Any decimal number that can be represented in 32 bits using [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format#IEEE_754_single-precision_binary_floating-point_format:_binary32). 
| String  | Text.  It consists of individual characters. Strings are enclosed in single quotation marks `'` or double quotation marks `"`. |
| Boolean   | The values `True` or `False`. |

In Python, when we are mentioning a variable or a constant for the first time, we must **assign** a value to it.

```python
height = 10 # we have created the variable height and assigned a value of 10 to it
height = 11 # we have changed the value of height from 10 to 11

person = "Chris" # we have created the variable person and assigned a value of "Chris" to it
```
In general, we should use descriptive names for variables to help create code that is self-explanatory.
