### String Concatenation

We can merge strings using the `+` operator.  The process of merging strings is called **string concatenation**.

The lines below print `"butterfly"`.

```python
print("butterfly")  # prints "butterfly"
print("butter" + " fly")  # also prints "butterfly"
```

The line below prints `"HelloWorld"`.

```python
print("Hello" + "World!")  # prints "HelloWorld"
```

To make it print `"Hello World"` (with the space in between) instead, we can put a space after `"Hello"` or before `"World"`.

```python
print("Hello " + "World!")  # prints "Hello World"
print("Hello" + " World!")  # also prints "Hello World"
print("Hello" + " " + "World!")  # also prints "Hello World"
```
