### Multi-Line Strings

Recall that **multi-line comments** take up multiple lines of code. In Python, they start with `'''` or `"""` and end the same way.

Multi-line strings share the same syntax as multi-line comments. 

```python
''' This is a multi-line comment.
It takes up more than one line of code.
'''

# the variable below stores a a multi-line string
numbers = '''3
5
6
7
'''  
```
In a multi-line string, we don't need any escape characters unless we have a backslash that is escaping the next character when we don't want it to (i.e. it's pink but you want it to be maroon).

```python
s1 = ''' \"
'''
s2 = ''' \\"
'''

print(s1)  # prints "
print(s2)  # prints \"
```

If we put a backslash at the end of a line in a multi-line string, it concatenates the line with the next line. This is called a **line break**.

```python
s = """Hello \
World!"""

print(s) # prints "Hello World!"
```
