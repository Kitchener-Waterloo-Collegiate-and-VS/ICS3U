### Hello World!

When using a programming language for the first time, it is traditional to run a program that prints "Hello World!".

The above image is an example of the Hello World program in Python using Replit. When we hit *Run*, the text "Hello World!" is printed to the console. 

### print()

The most common function for printing in Python is `print()`. Functions show up in purple on Replit. Anything we put inside the parentheses gets printed. If we are printing text, the text must be enclosed in double quotation marks `"` or single quotation marks `'`, which makes it a **string**. A string is composed of individual **characters**, such as letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and spaces. 

If we want to print more than one thing, we can separate the strings with commas.

``` python
print(Hello World!) # this won't work because the quotation marks are missing
```

```python
print("Hello World!") # prints "Hello World!"
print("Hello", "World!") # also prints "Hello World!"
```
