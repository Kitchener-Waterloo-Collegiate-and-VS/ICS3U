### Hello World!

When using a programming language for the first time, it is traditional to run a program that prints "Hello World!".

The above image is an example of the Hello World program in Python using Replit. When we hit *Run*, the text "Hello World!" is printed to the console. 

### print()

The most common function for printing in Python is `print()`. Functions show up in purple on Replit. Anything we put inside the parentheses gets printed. If we are printing text, the text must be enclosed in double quotation marks `"` or single quotation marks `'`, which makes it a **string**. A string is composed of individual **characters**, such as letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and spaces. 

If we want to print more than one thing, we can separate the strings with commas.

``` python
print(Hello World!) # this won't work because the quotation marks are missing
```

```python
print("Hello World!") # prints "Hello World!"
print("Hello", "World!") # also prints "Hello World!"
```

### Comments

Comments are used to write words in our program to help explain what is going on to someone reading our code. There are two types of comments: single-line and multi-line. 

* **Multi-line comments** take up multiple lines of code. In Python, they start with `'''` or `"""` and end the same way.

* **Single-line comments** take up only one line of code or one partial line of code. In Python, they start with `#`. These types of comments are typically used to provide a brief decription of what's going on in a particular line of code.

On Replit, single-line comments show up in grey and multi-line comments show up in maroon.

To change any lines into comments, we can highlight them and do *CRTL + /*.

### Delimiters

A **delimiter** is a symbol that indicates a starting point, a separating point, or an ending point. We've seen these delimiters so far.

* Functions like `print()` use `(`, `,` and `)` as delimiters.
* Multi-line comments use `'''` or `"""` as delimiters.
* Single-line comments use `#` as a delimiter.
* Strings use `"` or `'` as delimiters.
