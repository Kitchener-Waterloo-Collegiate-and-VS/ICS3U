### Custom Classes

We can make our own fields and methods depending on what we want to do with the class. The convention is to write custom class names using *UpperCamelCase*. Here is an example of custom class for an enemy for an adventure game. 

```python
class Enemy:
  pass  # We'll deal with this part later
```

We can make our own fields for the class by assigning variables. Here is an example of custom class for an enemy for an adventure game. 

```python
class Enemy:
  name = "Ganon"
  attacks = ["sword", "ice blocks", "tornado", "earthquake"]
  health = 100
```

To create an object, we call the **constructor**. The constructor is a method that shares the same name as the class, including the capitization.

```python
enemy = Enemy()
```

To access the fields of the object, we use dot notation.

```python
print(enemy.name)  # prints Ganon
print(enemy.attacks) # prints ["sword", "ice blocks", "tornado", "earthquake"]
print(enemy.health)  # prints 100
```
