### eval()

Python has a built-in function named `eval()` that takes a string and treats it as a math expression.

```
print(eval("14 + 8"))   # prints 22
print(eval("1 * 9"))   # prints 9

```

The `eval()` function can be useful when an expression you want to evaluate is stored as as a string, such as when you are getting the expression from user input or from a textfile.

```
exp = input("Enter a math expression: ")
print("The answer is", eval(exp))

``
