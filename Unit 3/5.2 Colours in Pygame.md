### Colours in Pygame

Most functions in Pygame that take a colour as a parameter can take the colour expressed as a tuple. For convenience, we can make constants for the colours we use in our program.

```python
# Initializing colours (using RGB values) so we can use them later
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
RED = (255, 0, 0)
GREEN = (0, 255, 0)
BLUE = (0, 0, 255)
```

The default colour of a screen in Pygame is black. We can change the colour of the screen using `screen.fill()` like this:

```python
# Initial setup
from pygame import *
init()
screen = display.set_mode((400, 300))

# Creates a constant for the colour white and makes the background this colour
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
screen.fill(WHITE) # makes the background white

# Keeps the program running and updating
while True:
  display.update()
```

Pygame also recognizes [all these colour names](https://www.webucator.com/article/python-color-constants-module/). To use any of them, we just write the name as a string.

```python
# Initial setup
from pygame import *
init()
screen = display.set_mode((400, 300))

# Makes the background white
screen.fill("white) # 'white' is a recognized colour name

# Keeps the program running and updating
while True:
  display.update()
```
