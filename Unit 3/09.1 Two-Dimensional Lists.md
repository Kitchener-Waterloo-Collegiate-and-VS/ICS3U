### 2D Lists

In Python, the term **2D list** is used for lists whose *elements* are 1D lists. Each inner list represents a row in a 2D grid.

The following grid can be represented using the 2D list`[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`.

| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
| 7 | 8 | 9 |


### Initializing 2D Lists

To initialize the 2D list above, we can do the following.

```python
row0 = [1, 2, 3]
row1 = [4, 5, 6]
row2 = [7, 8, 9]
grid = [row0, row1, row2]
```

### Accessing Cells in a 2D List

We can access an individual cell in a 2D list by its row number and column number. Don't forget that the first row has index 0 and the first item in each row also has index 0.

```python
row0 = [1, 2, 3]
row1 = [4, 5, 6]
row2 = [7, 8, 9]
grid = [row0, row1, row2]

print(grid[0][1])  # prints 2 (row 0, column 1)
print(grid[1][2])  # prints 6 (row 1, column 2)
print(grid[3][0])  # prints 7 (row 2, column 0)
```
