### Type Hinting

In many programming languages including Java, C, and C++, each variable's data types must be must be declared. 

Here's an example from C++.

```cpp
int multiplyTwoNumbers(int a, int b) {
  return a * b;
}

```
The `int` at the beginning indicates that the function `addTwoNumbers` will always return an integer and the `int` in front of `a` and `b` indicate that `a` and `b` must be integers.

We don't do this in Python, but we can use **type hinting** instead to give hints as to what data type we are expecting certain variables to be.

```python 
def multiply_two_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:  
  return a * b
```
In the example above, we have `a: int` and `b: int` to tell us that `a` and `b` should both be integers. 

We also have `-> int` to tell us that the return value will be an integer. 

These are just hints to the person reading the code â€“ the program doesn't do anything special when the arguments are not integers.
