### Abstract Methods and Classes

An **abstract method** is a method in a superclass whose implementation is missing. The body of the method is just `pass` (which is just a placeholder to prevent an `IndentationError`). 

If a superclass contains one or more abstract methods, it is an **abstract class**. If it's not an abstract class, it's a **concrete class**.

Inheritance works on abstract classes. For example, if you have a class called `Shape` that has two abstract methods: `get_perimeter()` and `get_area()`, other classes for specific shapes can inherit these methods from `Shape` and **override** their implementations.

```python
import math

class Shape:
  """An abstract class for a generic 2D shape."""
  
  def get_perimeter(self):
    """An abstract method for getting the perimeter of the shape."""
    pass
  
  def get_area(self):
    """An abstract method for getting the area of the shape."""
    pass
 
class Rectangle(Shape):
    """An concrete class for a rectangle."""
    
  def __init__(self, length, width):
    """A rectangle has a length and width."""
    self.length = length
    self.width = width
   
  def get_perimeter(self):
    """The perimeter is twice the sum of length and width."""
    return 2 * (self.length + self.width)
  
  def get_area(self):
    """The perimeter is the length ties the width."""
    return self.length * self.width
  
class Circle(Shape):
    """An concrete class for a circle."""
    
  def __init__(self, radius):
    """A circle has a radius."""
    self.radius = radius
   
  def get_perimeter(self):
    """The perimeter/circumfrence double pi times the radius."""
    return 2 * math.pi * self.radius
  
  def get_area(self):
    """The area is pi times the radius squared."""
    return math.pi * self.radius ** 2
```
