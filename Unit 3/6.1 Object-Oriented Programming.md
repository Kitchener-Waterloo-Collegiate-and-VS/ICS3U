### Object-Oriented Programming

There are three programming methodologies: **sequential programming**, **procedural programming**, and **object-oriented programming**. 

* Sequential programming involves executing a program line-by-line, in order.
* Procedural programming involves calling functions that perform routines and can be called at any point in a program.
* Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming methodology that involves separating a program into separate modules (e.g. files or classes).

You have been using all three methodologies in this course. OOP has the highest potential among them all when creating complex programs.
