### Abstract Methods and Classes

An **abstract method** is a method (in a superclass) whose implementation is missing. The body of the method is just `pass` (which is just a placeholder to prevent an `IndentationError`). 

If a superclass contains one or more abstract methods, it is an **abstract class**. 

Inheritance works on abstract classes. For example, if you have a class called `Shape` that has two abstract methods: `get_perimeter()` and `get_area()`, other classes for specific shapes can inherit these methods from `Shape` and **override** their implementations.

```python
import math

class Shape:
  def get_perimeter(self):
    pass
  
  def get_area(self):
    pass
 
class Rectangle(Shape):
  def __init__(self, length, width):
    self.length = length
    self.width = width
   
  def get_perimeter(self):
    return 2 * (self.length + self.width)
  
  def get_area(self):
    return self.length * self.width
  
class Circle(Shape):
  def __init__(self, radius):
    self.radius = radius
   
  def get_perimeter(self):
    return 2 * math.pi * self.radius
  
  def get_area(self):
    return math.pi * self.radius ** 2
```
