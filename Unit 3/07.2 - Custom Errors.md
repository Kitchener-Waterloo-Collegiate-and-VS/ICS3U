### Custom Errors

We can create our own custom errors if none of the built-in errors are suitable. We do that by creating a class that inherits the `Exception` class.

Suppose we are prompting a user to enter a word but we want to raise an error when the user doesn't follow the instructions and enters more than one word. We can create our own error, `WhitespaceError` since the input is not supposed to contain any whitespace (e.g. spaces, tabs, newlines).

```python
class WhitespaceError(Exception):
    __module__ = Exception.__module__  # sets the module to be the smae as the superclass, Exception
    def __init__(self, message = "Input should not contain any whitespace."):
        self.message = message
        super().__init__(self.message)  # this calls the constructor from the superclass, Exception

word = input("Enter a word: ")

# Checking the number of words by putting the input into a list split on whitespace
num_words = len(word.split())

if num_words != 1:
  raise WhitespaceError
```

The `super()` method lets us access the methods from ths superclass.
