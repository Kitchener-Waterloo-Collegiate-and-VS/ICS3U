### Unlimited Arguments

Recall that `print()` takes an unlimited number of arguments.

```python
print("This", "works", "even", "though", "there", "are
, "a", "lot", "of", "arguments.")
```

We can create custom functions that take an unlimited number of arguments by placing an *asterisk* `*` before the parameter. This is called **packing**.

```python
def multiply(*nums):
  """Takes an unlimited number of numbers and returns their product."""
  pass  # just a placeholder to prevent an IndentationError
```

In the example above, `nums` is a tuple. To access the items in the tuple, we can use a *for* loop.

```python
def multiply(*nums):
  """Takes an unlimited number of numbers and returns their product."""
  result = 1
  for num in nums:
    result *= num
  return result

print(multiply())  # prints 1
print(multiply(7))  # prints 7
print(multiply(6, -1))  # prints -5
print(multiply(5, 2, 9))  # prints 90
print(multiply(2, 8, -16, 11)) # prints -2816
````

### Packing

Packing can be used in other ways. For example, we can use it to create lists.

```python
*lst, = 1, 2, 3  # equivalent to lst = [1, 2, 3]
*start, end = 1, 2, 3  # equivalent to start = [1, 2]; end = 3
start, *end = 1, 2, 3  # equivalent to start = 1; end = [2, 3]
start, *mid, end = 1, 2, 3, 4  # equivalent to start = 1; mid = [2, 3]; end = 4
```

### Unpacking

**Unpacking** is the inverse of packing. It involves taking a sequential data type and extracting its individual items.

We can unpack strings, lists, tuples, ranges, and several other data types. We do that by assigning one variable for each individual item.

```python
x, y = [3, 5]
print(x)  # prints 3
print(y)  # prints 4

a, b, c = "123"
print(a)  # prints 1
print(b)  # prints 2
print(c)  # prints 3

x, y, z = (3, 5)  # raises a ValueError
x, y = (3, 5, 7)  # raises a different ValueError
```

One of the most interesting ways to use unpacking is to swap variables.

```python
x, y = 3, 5  # shortcut for x = 3; y = 5

x, y = y, x  # swaps the values of x and y

print(x)  # prints 5
print(y)  # prints 3
```

The traditional way of swapping variables is to use a third variable to temporarily hold one of the values.

```
x, y = 3, 5  # shortcut for x = 3; y = 5

temp = x  # stores the value of x so we don't lose it
x = y  # x is y's old value
y = temp  # y is x's old value, which is stored in temp

print(x)  # prints 5
print(y)  # prints 3
```
