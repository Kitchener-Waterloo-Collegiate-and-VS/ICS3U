### Custom Methods

We can override built-in methods in custom classes, but we can also make our own custom methods too. The syntax is the same as any other function.

```python
class Enemy:
  """An enemy in an adventure game."""

  def __init__(self, name, attacks, health):
    """The constructor takes a name, a list of attacks, and a number of health points."""
    self.name = name
    self.attacks = attacks
    self.health = health

  def __repr__(self):
    """Printing the objects displays the name, list of attacks, and health points."""
    line1 = "Name: " + self.name
    line2 = "\nAttacks: " + str(self.attacks)
    line3 = "\nHealth: " + str(self.health)
    return line1 + line2 + line3

  def take_damage(self, d):  # custom method for reducing the health points
    """Reduces the enemy's health by d points and ensures it doesn't go below zero."""
    assert 0 <= d  # if d is negative they'd be gaining health points
    self.health -= d
    if self.health < 0:  # health can't be negative
      self.health = 0

  def attack(self, attack_name):  # custom method for an ememy attack
    """Prints a message indicating an enemy attack."""
    assert attack_name in self.attacks  # ensures that the attack is valid
    print(f"{self.name} used {attack_name} attack!")
```

We call custom methods using dot notation, just like any other method.

```python
final_boss = Enemy("Ganon", ["sword", "ice blocks", "tornado", "earthquake"], 100) # Creates an enemy object
final_boss.take_damage(10) # Decreases its health points by 10
final_boss.attack("sword") # Prints "Ganon uses sword attack!"
print(final_boss)
''' prints the following:
Ganon used sword attack!
Name: Ganon
Attacks: ['sword', 'ice blocks', 'tornado', 'earthquake']
Health: 90
'''
```
