### Packing

**Packing** involves taking several values and placing them into a list, tuple, or other seeuqntial data type. To create a packed variable, we put an asterisk in front of it, which we pronounced as **splat**.

```python
*lst, = 1, 2, 3  # equivalent to lst = [1, 2, 3]
*start, end = 1, 2, 3  # equivalent to start = [1, 2]; end = 3
start, *end = 1, 2, 3  # equivalent to start = 1; end = [2, 3]
start, *mid, end = 1, 2, 3, 4  # equivalent to start = 1; mid = [2, 3]; end = 4
```

### Unpacking

**Unpacking** is the inverse of packing. It involves taking a sequential data type and extracting its individual items.

We can unpack strings, lists, tuples, ranges, and several other data types. We do that by assigning one variable for each individual item.

```python
x, y = [3, 5]
print(x)  # prints 3
print(y)  # prints 4

a, b, c = "123"
print(a)  # prints 1
print(b)  # prints 2
print(c)  # prints 3

x, y, z = (3, 5)  # raises a ValueError
x, y = (3, 5, 7)  # raises a different ValueError
```

One of the most interesting ways to use unpacking is to swap variables. The traditional way of swapping variables is to use a third variable to temporarily hold one of the values.

```python
x, y = [3, 5]  # shortcut for x = 3; y = 5

temp = x  # stores the value of x so we don't lose it
x = y  # x is y's old value
y = temp  # y is x's old value, which is stored in temp

print(x)  # prints 5
print(y)  # prints 3
```

If we use unpacking, our solution is shorter and easier to read. We can also omit the brackets when we're unpacking.

```python
x, y = 3, 5  # doesn't actually need brackets

x, y = y, x  # swaps the values of x and y

print(x)  # prints 5
print(y)  # prints 3
```
