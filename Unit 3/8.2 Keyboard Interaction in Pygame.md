### Keyboard Interaction in Pygame

In Pygame, we can create programs that involve  keyboard interactions. We can control what happens on the screen with our keyboard. 

To do this, we check through the list `event.get()` within the infinite while loop. This list includes events that tell us which keys on the keyboard have just been pressed.

These are the names of the event types we'll be using for keyboard interaction. They are written in all capital letters since they are constants.

* `KEYDOWN`
* `KEYUP`

### Keyboard Controls

```python
# Pygame needs to be imported
import pygame as pg

# Initial setup
pg.init()
WIDTH = 400
HEIGHT = 300
screen = pg.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))

# Keeps track of a position of the circle on the screen
position = [WIDTH/2, HEIGHT/2]

# Keeps the program running
while True:
  # Repaints the background to cover up previous circles
  screen.fill("white")
  # Draws a circle at the new location
  pg.draw.circle(screen, "green", position, 25)
  for event in pg.event.get():
    # Checks for keys that have been pressed
    if event.type == pg.KEYDOWN:
      if event.key == pg.K_LEFT:
        # Moves the position 10 pixels left
        position[0] -= 10
      if event.key == pg.K_RIGHT:
        # Moves the position 10 pixels right
        position[0] += 10
      if event.key == pg.K_UP:
        # Moves the position 10 pixels up
        position[1] -= 10
      if event.key == pg.K_DOWN:
        # Moves the position 10 pixels down
        position[1] += 10
      if event.key == pg.K_SPACE:
        # Moves the position back to (200, 100)
        position = [200, 100]    
  pg.display.update()
```

We can get the entire list of the names of keys here: https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html.

We may also want to hold down a key and have something happen as long as they key is continuously held down. In that case, we can use the tuple `key.get_pressed()` which tells us which keys are currently being held down. Each item in `key.get_pressed()` represents a key and is a `0` (`False`) or `1` (`True`) value.  `key.get_pressed()` only works if `event.get()` is called.

```python
# Pygame needs to be imported
import pygame as pg

# Initial setup
pg.init()
WIDTH = 400
HEIGHT = 300
screen = pg.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))

# Keeps track of a position of the circle on the screen
position = [WIDTH/2, HEIGHT/2]

# Keeps the program running
while True:
  # Repaints the background to cover up previous circles
  screen.fill("white")
  # Draws a circle at the new location
  pg.draw.circle(screen, "green", position, 25)
  pg.event.get() # This line is needed for keys.get_pressed() to work
  pressed_keys = pg.key.get_pressed()
  if pressed_keys[pg.K_LEFT]:
    # Moves the position 1 pixel left
    position[0] -= 1
  if pressed_keys[pg.K_RIGHT]:
    # Moves the position 1 pixel right
    position[0] += 1
  if pressed_keys[pg.K_UP]:
    # Moves the position 1 pixel up
    position[1] -= 1
  if pressed_keys[pg.K_DOWN]:
    # Moves the position 1 pixel down
    position[1] += 1
  pg.display.update()
```

If we want to change the frame rate, we can put `time.Clock().tick(20)` (replace 20 with the new frame rate) in the loop. By default, the frame rate is 60 frames per second, meaning the maximum number of times `display.update()` is called per second is 60 times.
