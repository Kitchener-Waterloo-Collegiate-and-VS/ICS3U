### Unlimited Arguments

Recall that `print()` takes an unlimited number of arguments.

```python
print("This", "works", "even", "though", "there", "are
, "a", "lot", "of", "arguments.")
```

We can create custom functions that take an unlimited number of arguments by placing an *asterisk* `*` before the parameter. This is called **packing**.

```python
def multiply(*nums):
  """Takes an unlimited number of numbers and returns their product."""
  pass  # just a placeholder to prevent an IndentationError
```

In the example above, `nums` is a tuple. To access the items in the tuple, we can use a *for* loop.

```python
def multiply(*nums):
  """Takes an unlimited number of numbers and returns their product."""
  result = 1
  for num in nums:
    result *= num
  return result

print(multiply())  # prints 1
print(multiply(7))  # prints 7
print(multiply(6, -1))  # prints -5
print(multiply(5, 2, 9))  # prints 90
print(multiply(2, 8, -16, 11)) # prints -2816
````

### Packing

Packing can be used in other ways. For example, we can use it to create lists.

```python
*lst, = 1, 2, 3  # equivalent to lst = [1, 2, 3]
*start, end = 1, 2, 3  # equivalent to start = [1, 2]; end = 3
start, *end = 1, 2, 3  # equivalent to start = 1; end = [2, 3]
start, *mid, end = 1, 2, 3, 4  # equivalent to start = 1; mid = [2, 3]; end = 4
```
