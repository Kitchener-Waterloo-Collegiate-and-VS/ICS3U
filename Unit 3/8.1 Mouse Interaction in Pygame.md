### Mouse Interactions in Pygame

In Pygame, we can create programs that involve mouse interactions. We can control what happens on the screen with our mouse.

To do this, we check through the list `event.get()` within the infinite while loop. This list contains **events**, which include information about where the mouse cursor is and which mouse buttons have just been pressed.

These are the names of the event types we'll be using for mouse events. They are written in all capital letters since they are constants.

* `MOUSEMOTION`
* `MOUSEBUTTONUP`
* `MOUSEBUTTONDOWN`

### Mouse Movement

Here is how we can store and use the location of the mouse cursor on the screen:

```python
# Pygame needs to be imported
import pygame as pg

# Initial setup
pg.init()
screen = pg.display.set_mode((400, 300))
screen.fill("white")

# Keeps the program running
while True:
  for e in pg.event.get():  # we can't use the "event" as a variable name since it's a keyword in pygame
    # Checks for mouse motion
      if e.type == pg.MOUSEMOTION:
        # Gets the coordinates of the mouse
        mouse_x = pg.mouse.get_pos()[0]
        mouse_y = pg.mouse.get_pos()[1]
        print(mouse_x, mouse_y)  # prints the mouse coordinates to the screen when the mouse moves
```

### Mouse Clicking

Here is how we can check whether the mouse has been left-clicked or right-clicked.

```python
# Pygame needs to be imported
import pygame as pg

# Initial setup
pg.init()
screen = pg.display.set_mode((400, 300))
screen.fill("white")

# Keeps the program running
while True:
  for e in pg.event.get():
    # Checks for mouse clicking
    if e.type == pg.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:
      # Checks whether the left or right mouse buttons were clicked
      left_clicked = pg.mouse.get_pressed()[0]
      right_clicked = pg.mouse.get_pressed()[2]
      if left_clicked:
        print("You did a left click.")
      if right_clicked:
        print("You did a right click.")
```
