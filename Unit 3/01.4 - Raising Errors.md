### Raising Errors

We've seen a variety of error messages that appear when our programs end abruptly. We can create our own errors messages too.

```python
def integers_only(*nums: int):
  for num in nums:
    if type(num) != int:
      raise TypeError("The arguments must be integers.")

integers_only("hi")  # prints a red error message saying "TypeError: The arguments must be integers."
``` 

The keyword `raise` is used to raise an error. We can use any of [the built-in errors](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html) or we can use a generic `Exception` ("exception" is another word for "error") if we don't want to specify what type of error happened. 

```python
def add_integers(*nums: int):
  try:
    total = 0
    for num in nums:
      total += num
    return num
  except:
    raise Exception("Something went wrong.")

add_integers("hi")  # prints a red error message saying "Exception: Something went wrong."
``` 

We can also create our own custom errors, which we'll do later this unit.
