### Images in Turtle

We've been using the `shape()` function to change the shape from an arrow to a turtle. We can make our own custom shapes from image files as long as it's a GIF (if it's a PNG or JPG, we have to convert it first). We can use this strategy to place an image on the window. We also need to ensure that the image's size fits in the window since we can't resize the image in Turtle. We might need photo editing software to do that.

```python
# Importing the turtle module
from turtle import *
from turtle import _CFG  # we need this to remove the scrollers

# Resizes the default canvas size to prevent scrollers
_CFG["canvwidth"] = 1 
_CFG["canvheight"] = 1

# Creates a window with the size 400 by 300 and sets the title
setup(400, 300)
title("My Turtle Animation")

# The image is turned into a shape and the turtle puts the image onto the window
addshape("doge.gif")
shape("doge.gif")

# Hides the turtle after they are done drawing
hideturtle()

# Keeps the program running after the drawing is complete
done()
```
