### Keyboard Interaction in Pygame

In Pygame, we can create programs that involve  keyboard interactions. We can control what happens on the screen with our keyboard. 

To do this, we check through the list `event.get()` within the infinite while loop. This list includes events that tell us which keys on the keyboard have just been pressed.

These are the names of the event types we'll be using for keyboard interaction. They are written in all capital letters since they are constants.

* `KEYDOWN`
* `KEYUP`

### Keyboard Controls

```python
# Pygame needs to be imported
from pygame import *

# Initial setup
init()
screen = display.set_mode((400, 300))

# Keeps track of a position on the screen
position = [200, 150]

# Initializing colours
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
GREEN = (0, 255, 0)

# Makes the background white
screen.fill(WHITE)

# Draws a circle located at the position list
draw.circle(screen, GREEN, position, 25)

# Keeps the program running
while True:
  display.update()
  for e in event.get():
    # Checks for keys that have been pressed
    if e.type == KEYDOWN:
      if e.key == K_LEFT:
        # Moves the position 10 pixels left
        position[0] -= 10
      if e.key == K_RIGHT:
        # Moves the position 10 pixels right
        position[0] += 10
      if e.key == K_UP:
        # Moves the position 10 pixels up
        position[1] -= 10
      if e.key == K_DOWN:
        # Moves the position 10 pixels down
        position[1] += 10
      if e.key == K_SPACE:
        # Moves the position back to (0, 0)
        position = [0, 0]        
      if e.key == K_ESCAPE:
        # Stops Pygame and the whole program
        display.quit()
        from sys import exit
        exit()
      # Repaints the background to cover up previous circles
      screen.fill(WHITE)
      # Draws a circle at the new location
      draw.circle(screen, GREEN, position, 25)
      display.update()
```

We can get the entire list of the names of keys here: https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html.

We may also want to hold down a key and have something happen as long as they key is continuously held down. In that case, we can use the tuple `key.get_pressed()` which tells us which keys are currently being held down. Each item in `key.get_pressed()` represents a key and is a `0` (`False`) or `1` (`True`) value.  `key.get_pressed()` only works if `event.get()` is called.

```python
# Pygame needs to be imported
from pygame import *

# Initial setup
init()
WIDTH = 400
HEIGHT = 300
screen = display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))

# Keeps track of a position on the screen
position = [WIDTH/2, HEIGHT/2]

# Initializing colours
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
GREEN = (0, 255, 0)

# Makes the background white
screen.fill(WHITE)

# Draws a circle at the new location
draw.circle(screen, GREEN, position, 25)

# Keeps the program running
while True:
  event.get() # This line is needed for keys.get_pressed() to work
  pressed_keys = key.get_pressed()
  if pressed_keys[K_LEFT]:
    # Moves the position 1 pixel left
    position[0] -= 1
  if pressed_keys[K_RIGHT]:
    # Moves the position 1 pixel right
    position[0] += 1
  if pressed_keys[K_UP]:
    # Moves the position 1 pixel up
    position[1] -= 1
  if pressed_keys[K_DOWN]:
    # Moves the position 1 pixel down
    position[1] += 1
  # Repaints the background to cover up previous circles
  screen.fill(WHITE)
  # Draws a circle at the new location
  draw.circle(screen, GREEN, position, 25)
  display.update()
```
