### Keyboard Interactions in Pygame

In Pygame, we can create programs that involve  keyboard interactions. We can control what happens on the screen with our keyboard. 

To do this, we check through the list `pygame.event.get()` within the infinite while loop. This list includes events that tell us which keys on the keyboard have just been pressed.

These are the names of the event types we'll be using for keyboard interaction. They are written in all capital letters since they are constants.

* `KEYDOWN`
* `KEYUP`

### Keyboard Controls

```python
position = [0, 0]

while True:
  for event in event.get():
    # Checks for keys that have been pressed
    if event.type == KEYDOWN:
      if event.key == K_LEFT:
        # Moves the position 10 pixels left
        position[0] -= 10
      if event.key == K_RIGHT:
        # Moves the position 10 pixels right
        position[0] += 10
      if event.key == K_UP:
        # Moves the position 10 pixels up
        position[1] -= 10
      if event.key == K_DOWN:
        # Moves the position 10 pixels down
        position[1] += 10
      if event.key == K_SPACE:
        # Moves the position back to (0, 0)
        position = [0, 0]        
      if event.key == K_ESCAPE:
        # Stops Pygame and the whole program
        display.quit()
        sys.exit()
```

We can get the entire list of the names of keys here: https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html.

We may also want to hold down a key and have something happen as long as they key is continuously held down. In that case, we can use the tuple `pygame.key.get_pressed()` which tells us which keys are currently being held down. Each item in `pygame.key.get_pressed()` represents a key and is a `0` (`False`) or `1` (`True`) value.

```python
position = [0, 0]

while True:
  for event in event.get():
    pressed_keys = key.get_pressed()
    if pressed_keys[pygame.K_LEFT]:
      # Moves the position 1 pixel left
      position[0] -= 1
    if pressed_keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]:
      # Moves the position 1 pixel right
      position[0] += 1
    if pressed_keys[pygame.K_UP]:
      # Moves the position 1 pixel up
      position[1] -= 1
    if pressed_keys[pygame.K_DOWN]:
      # Moves the position 1 pixel down
      position[1] += 1
```
