### Mouse Interactions in Pygame

In Pygame, we can create programs that involve mouse interactions. We can control what happens on the screen with our mouse.

To do this, we check through the list `pygame.event.get()` within the infinite while loop. This list contains **events**, which tells us information about where the mouse cursor is and which mouse buttons have just been pressed.

These are the names of the event types we'll be using for mouse events. They are written in all capital letters since they are constants.

* `MOUSEMOTION`
* `MOUSEBUTTONUP`
* `MOUSEBUTTONDOWN`

### Mouse Movement

Here is how we can store and use the location of the mouse cursor on the screen:

```python
while True:
  for event in pygame.event.get():
    # Checks for mouse motion
      if event.type == pygame.MOUSEMOTION:
        # Gets the coordinates of the mouse
        mouse_x = pygame.mouse.get_pos()[0]
        mouse_y = pygame.mouse.get_pos()[1]
```

We can then use the variables `mouse_x` and `mouse_y` to place graphics where the mouse is.

### Mouse Clicking

Here is how we can check whether the mouse has been left-clicked or right-clicked.

```python
while True:
  for event in pygame.event.get():
  	# Checks for mouse clicking
    if event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:
      # Checks whether the left or right mouse buttons were clicked
      left_clicked = pygame.mouse.get_pressed()[0]
      right_clicked = pygame.mouse.get_pressed()[2]
```

We can then create conditional statements based on whether `left_clicked` or `right_clicked` are `True` or `False`.
